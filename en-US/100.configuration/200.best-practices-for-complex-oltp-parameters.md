# Recommended configurations in complex OLTP scenarios

To help users achieve optimal performance with OceanBase Database across various business scenarios, OceanBase has summarized some recommended configurations for key parameters and variables based on extensive tuning experience from numerous real-world scenarios. This topic introduces the recommended configurations for parameters in complex online transaction processing (OLTP) scenarios.

## Background information

In a complex OLTP scenario, large amounts of data and intricate transactions are processed. It is commonly used in banking and insurance systems, where workloads often involve complex join operations, complex join subqueries, batch processing jobs compiled in Programming Language (PL), and long, large transactions, or large transactions. Sometimes, parallel execution strategies are employed to speed up short-duration queries.

## Configuration template

Starting from V4.3.2, OceanBase Database provides recommended parameter configuration templates for different business scenarios in the installation package. After installing OceanBase RPM package, you can find these templates in the `/home/admin/oceanbase/etc` directory, where:

* `default_parameter.json` stores recommended parameter configurations.
* `default_system_variable.json` stores recommended variables  configurations.

## Recommended configurations for OceanBase Database V4.3.2

This section takes OceanBase Database V4.3.2 as an example to introduce the recommended configurations for V4.3.x. You can view the recommended configurations for a version later than V4.3.2 in the configuration template for the corresponding version.

In this scenario, there are currently no recommended variable configurations.

### Recommended parameter configurations

The table below lists the recommended parameters and their descriptions for this scenario.

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Default value** |  **Value range**  | **Recommended value** | **Applicable scope** | **Effective upon OBServer node restart?** |
|------------|----------|------------|------------|----------------------------------|----------| --- |
| large_query_threshold | The execution time threshold to identify a large query. A request may be suspended if its execution time exceeds this threshold. A suspended request is considered a large query and is processed by following the large query scheduling strategy. | 5s | <ul><li>For OceanBase Database V4.x earlier than V4.3.0: [1ms, +∞)</li><li>For OceanBase Database V4.3.0 and later: [0ms, +∞)</li></ul> | 600s.</br>The query execution may last a long time in a scenario that involves complex OLTP workloads. | Cluster | No |
| _enable_defensive_check | Specifies whether to perform defensive checks during the execution of a query. | 1 | <ul><li>True</li><li>False</li></ul> | 0.</br>Disabling defensive checks in the production environment can increase the performance by 3%. | Cluster | No |
| enable_syslog_recycle | Specifies whether to record the logs generated before the startup of the OBServer node. You can use this parameter with `max_syslog_file_count` to specify whether to include earlier log files in the recycling logic. | False | <ul><li>True</li><li>False</li></ul> | True.</br>This value specifies to enable automatic system log recycling, so as to prevent log files from occupying disk space. | Cluster | No |
| max_syslog_file_count | The maximum number of system log files that can be retained. | 0 | [0, +∞) | 300.</br>Set the parameter to an appropriate value when `enable_syslog_recycle` is set to `True`. | Cluster | No |
| _rowsets_max_rows | The maximum number of rows processed in a vectorized execution by the SQL engine. | 256 | [1, 65536] | 4.</br>This value can maximize the effectiveness for complex OLTP workloads. | Tenant | No |
| log_transport_compress_all | Specifies whether to compress logs for transmission. | False | <ul><li>`True`: specifies to compress logs for transmission.</li><li>`False`: specifies not to compress logs for transmission.</li></ul> | True.</br>Remote procedure call (RPC) compression can reduce the CPU overhead when the bandwidth resources are limited. | Tenant | No |

### Configuration examples

* To configure cluster-level parameters in the `sys` tenant, execute the following statements:

    ```shell
    obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET large_query_threshold = '600s';
    obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET _enable_defensive_check = 0;
    obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET enable_syslog_recycle = True;
    obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET max_syslog_file_count = 300;
    ```

* To configure tenant-level parameters in a user tenant, execute the following statements:

    :::tab
    tab MySQL tenant

    ```shell

Do not trigger major compactions during work hours or frequently. </p></main>  | Cluster | No |
|  memstore_limit_percentage  | The percentage of the memory that can be occupied by the MemStore to the total available memory of the tenant. The memory occupied by the MemStore is calculated as follows: min_memory × memstore_limit_percentage, where `min_memory` is specified when you create the tenant.  |  50  |  [1, 99]  | 80. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>For large-scale tenants, such as those with 32 CPU cores and 256 GB of memory, or tenants with more writes than reads, you can increase the value of `memstore_limit_percentage` to cache more updated data, so as not to frequently trigger minor compactions. </p></main>  | Cluster | No |
|  minor_freeze_times | The number of minor compactions that triggers a global major compaction. <main id="notice" type='explain'><ul><li>This parameter is equivalent to the `major_compact_trigger` parameter. </li><li>The value `0` specifies to disable minor compactions. </li></ul></main> |  5  |  [0, 65535]  | 50. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>Specify the parameter based on the actual amount of incremental data generated every day. Do not trigger major compactions during work hours or frequently. </p></main>  | Cluster | No |
|  trace_log_slow_query_watermark | The threshold of the query execution duration. A query whose execution duration exceeds this threshold is considered a slow query. Trace logs of slow queries are written to system logs.  |  1s  |  [1ms,+∞)  | 100ms  | Cluster | No |
| enable_syslog_recycle | Specifies whether to record the logs generated before the startup of the OBServer node. You can use this parameter with `max_syslog_file_count` to specify whether to include earlier log files in the recycling logic. | False | <ul><li>True</li><li>False</li></ul> | True. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>This value specifies to enable automatic system log recycling, so as to prevent log files from occupying disk space. </p></main>  | Cluster | No |
|  max_syslog_file_count |  The maximum number of system log files that can be retained. Each log file can occupy at most 256 MB of disk space. If this parameter is set to `0`, no log files are deleted.  |  0  |  [0, +∞)  | 500. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p> Specify the parameter based on the actual reserved space and log retention strategy. Each log file can occupy at most 256 MB of disk space. You need to specify the maximum log file size based on the actual disk capacity to avoid using up the disk space. </p></main>  | Cluster | No |

|  writing_throttling_trigger_percentage | The threshold of write speed that triggers throttling. When the memory used by the MemStore reaches the threshold, the write speed limit is triggered. If this parameter is set to `100`, write throttling is disabled.  |  100  |  [1, 100]  | 80. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p> In a scenario with a small tenant memory size or a high write speed, we recommend that you set the parameter to `80` or `90` to prevent the space of the MemStore from being used up. In addition, the value of `writing_throttling_trigger_percentage` must be greater than that of `freeze_trigger_percentage`. </p></main>  | Tenant | No |

A timeout occurs when the execution interval between two statements exceeds the value of this parameter.  |  120000000  |  [0,+∞)  |  120000000  | <ul><li>Global</li><li>Session</li></ul> |
|  ob_trx_timeout | The transaction timeout period in microseconds.  |  100000000  |  [0, 3216672000000000]  |  100000000  | <ul><li>Global</li><li>Session</li></ul> |
|  undo_retention | The time range in seconds of data versions to be retained by the system. This variable is used to control the collection of data of multiple versions in minor compactions. <ul><li>When `undo_retention` is set to `0`, multi-version minor compaction is disabled, which indicates that only the latest version of row data is retained in the minor compaction file. </li><li>When `undo_retention` is set to a value greater than 0, multi-version minor compaction is enabled, and multiple versions of row data within the specified period in seconds are retained in the minor compaction file. </li></ul> <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p>After multi-version minor compaction is enabled for the tenant, the corresponding incremental minor compaction files are retained in a major compaction, but multi-version data is not stored in the Major SSTable to prevent the number of retained SSTable files from exceeding the limit, we recommend that you do not set this parameter to an excessively large value. </p></main>  |  1800  |  [0, 2^32)  |  0  | Global |
|  ob_sql_work_area_percentage | The percentage of the SQL workspace memory to the total memory of the tenant.

You can also increase the parameter value in read-only or analytical processing (AP) scenarios. </p></main>  | Global |
|  parallel_servers_target | Specifies the queuing condition for parallel queries on each server. If this variable is set to `0`, the queuing condition is calculated based on the maximum number of CPUs of the tenant. When the number of threads taken by Parallel eXecution (PX) of multiple SQL queries exceeds the specified queuing condition, subsequent SQL queries for PX must wait in a queue.  |  0  |  [0, 9223372036854775807]  |  Number of CPU cores of the tenant × 10  | Global |
|  max_allowed_packet | The maximum size in bytes of a network packet. <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p>You can use the <code>SET GLOBAL</code> statement to modify the global value of the variable. However, you cannot use the <code>ALTER SESSION SET</code> statement to modify a session value of the variable. You can only view the session value. The session value must be the same as the global value. Generally, this variable must be adjusted both in the client and the server. </p></main>  |  4194304  |  [1024,1073741824]  |  4194304. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>You can increase the value in scenarios where large amounts of data is to be updated, such as data migration and large queries. </p></main>   | <ul><li>Global</li><li>Session</li></ul> |
|  ob_timestamp_service | The timestamp service. <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p>If this variable is set to `LTS` for a user tenant, the tenant does not support cross-server strong-consistency reads or distributed transactions. </p></main>  |  <ul><li>The value is `LTS` for the `sys` tenant. </li><li>The value is `GTS` for a user tenant. </li></ul>  | <ul><li>`LTS`: During transaction execution, the local timestamp on the server is used as the snapshot for transactions. Access across partitions is not supported. </li><li>`GTS`: During transaction execution, a global timestamp is obtained from GTS as the snapshot and commit version number of transactions. The use purpose is not limited.</li></ul> |  GTS  | Global |
|  nls_date_format |  The format of converting a date to a string and the format of implicitly converting a string to a date. This parameter applies only to the Oracle mode.  |  DD-MON-RR  |  N/A  |  DD-MON-RR  | <ul><li>Global</li><li>Session</li></ul> |
