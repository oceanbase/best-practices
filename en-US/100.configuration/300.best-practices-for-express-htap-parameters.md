# Recommended configurations in HTAP scenarios

To help users achieve optimal performance with OceanBase Database across various business scenarios, OceanBase has summarized some recommended configurations for key parameters and variables based on extensive tuning experience from numerous real-world scenarios. This topic introduces the recommended configurations for parameters in hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP) scenarios.

## Background information

HTAP is a database management system or architecture that supports both online transaction processing (OLTP) and online analytical processing (OLAP). HTAP applies to business environments in industries such as financial transactions, retailing, and logistics, where data needs to be analyzed and queried in real time and transactions need to efficiently processed to support business decision-making and analysis. The HTAP architecture features lower data replication and conversion costs and real-time data analysis to speed up business decision-making.

## Configuration template

Starting from V4.3.2, OceanBase Database provides recommended parameter configuration templates for different business scenarios in the installation package. After installing OceanBase RPM package, you can find these templates in the `/home/admin/oceanbase/etc` directory, where:

* `default_parameter.json` stores recommended parameter configurations.
* `default_system_variable.json` stores recommended variables  configurations.

## Applicable version

This content applies to OceanBase Database V4.3.2.

This section takes OceanBase Database V4.3.2 as an example to introduce the recommended configurations for V4.3.x. You can view the recommended configurations for a version later than V4.3.2 in the configuration template for the corresponding version.

## Recommended parameter configurations

In this scenario, there are currently no recommended variable configurations.

The table below lists the recommended parameters and their descriptions for this scenario.

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Default value** |  **Value range**  | **Recommended value** | **Applicable scope** | **Effective upon OBServer node restart?** |
|------------|----------|------------|------------|--------------------------|----------|----------|
| large_query_threshold | The execution time threshold to identify a large query. A request may be suspended if its execution time exceeds this threshold. A suspended request is considered a large query and is processed by following the large query scheduling strategy. | 5s | <ul><li>For OceanBase Database V4.x earlier than V4.3.0: [1ms, +∞)</li><li>For OceanBase Database V4.3.0 and later: [0ms, +∞)</li></ul> | 600s.</br>Set this parameter to a value that can ensure quick execution of analytical processing (AP) queries for HTAP workloads. | Cluster | No |
| enable_syslog_recycle | Specifies whether to record the logs generated before the startup of the OBServer node. You can use this parameter with `max_syslog_file_count` to specify whether to include earlier log files in the recycling logic. | False | <ul><li>True</li><li>False</li></ul> | True.</br>This value specifies to enable automatic system log recycling, so as to prevent log files from occupying disk space. | Cluster | No |
| max_syslog_file_count | The maximum number of system log files that can be retained. | 0 | [0, +∞) | 300.</br>Set the parameter to an appropriate value when `enable_syslog_recycle` is set to `True`. | Cluster | No |
| _rowsets_max_rows | The maximum number of rows processed in a vectorized execution by the SQL engine. | 256 | [1, 65536] | 32.</br>This value is optimal for classic HTAP workloads. | Tenant | No |
| log_transport_compress_all | Specifies whether to compress logs for transmission. | False | <ul><li>`True`: specifies to compress logs for transmission.</li><li>`False`: specifies not to compress logs for transmission.</li></ul> | True.</br>Remote procedure call (RPC) compression can reduce the CPU overhead when the bandwidth resources are limited. | Tenant | No |

## Configuration examples

* To configure cluster-level parameters in the `sys` tenant, execute the following statements:

    ```shell
    obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET large_query_threshold = '600s';
    obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET enable_syslog_recycle = True;
    obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET max_syslog_file_count = 300;
    ```

* To configure tenant-level parameters in a user tenant, execute the following statements:

    :::tab
    tab MySQL tenant

    ```shell
    obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET _rowsets_max_rows = 32;
    obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET log_transport_compress_all = True;
    ```

    tab Oracle tenant

    ```shell
    obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET "_rowsets_max_rows" = 32;
    obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET log_transport_compress_all = True;
    ```
