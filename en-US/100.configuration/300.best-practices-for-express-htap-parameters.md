# Recommended configurations for HTAP

OceanBase summarizes the recommended configurations of core parameters and variables for various business scenarios based on its tuning experience from a large number of real scenarios. OceanBase Database can provide high performance in various business scenarios based on the recommended configurations. This topic describes the recommended configurations for hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP).

## Background information

HTAP is a database management system or architecture that supports both online transaction processing (OLTP) and online analytical processing (OLAP). HTAP applies to business environments in industries such as financial transactions, retailing, and logistics, where data needs to be analyzed and queried in real time and transactions need to efficiently processed to support business decision-making and analysis. The HTAP architecture features lower data replication and conversion costs and real-time data analysis to speed up business decision-making.

## Configuration template

OceanBase Database incorporates the templates of recommended configurations for different business scenarios in the installation package since V4.3.2. After you install the RPM package of OceanBase Database, you can find the configuration templates in the `/home/admin/oceanbase/etc` directory.

* `default_parameter.json` stores the recommended configurations of parameters.
* `default_system_variable.json` stores the recommended configurations of variables.

## Applicable version

The HTAP scenario applies only to OceanBase Database V4.3.2.

This section takes OceanBase Database V4.3.2 as an example to describe the recommended configurations for V4.3.x. You can view the recommended configurations for a version later than V4.3.2 in the configuration template for the corresponding version.

## Recommended parameter configurations

No configurations are recommended for variables in this scenario.

The following table describes the recommended parameter configurations for HTAP.

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Default value** |  **Value range**  | **Recommended value** | **Level** | **Effective upon OBServer node restart** |
|------------|----------|------------|------------|--------------------------|----------|----------|
| large_query_threshold | The execution time threshold to identify a large query. A request may be suspended if its execution time exceeds this threshold. A suspended request is considered a large query and is processed by following the large query scheduling strategy. | 5s | <ul><li>For Oceanbase Database V4.x earlier than V4.3.0: [1ms, +∞)</li><li>For Oceanbase Database V4.3.0 and later: [0ms, +∞)</li></ul> | 600s</br>Set this parameter to a value that can ensure quick execution of analytical processing (AP) queries for HTAP workloads. | Cluster-level parameter | No |
| enable_syslog_recycle | Specifies whether to record the logs generated before the startup of the OBServer node. You can use this parameter with `max_syslog_file_count` to specify whether to include earlier log files in the recycling logic. | False | <ul><li>True</li><li>False</li></ul> | True</br>This value specifies to enable automatic system log recycling, so as to prevent log files from occupying disk space. | Cluster-level parameter | No |
| max_syslog_file_count | The maximum number of system log files that can be retained. | 0 | [0, +∞) | 300</br>Set the parameter to an appropriate value when `enable_syslog_recycle` is set to `True`. | Cluster-level parameter | No |
| _rowsets_max_rows | The maximum number of rows processed in a vectorized execution by the SQL engine. | 256 | [1, 65536] | 32</br>This value is optimal for classic HTAP workloads. | Tenant-level parameter | No |
| log_transport_compress_all | Specifies whether to compress logs for transmission. | False | <ul><li>`True`: specifies to compress logs for transmission.</li><li>`False`: specifies not to compress logs for transmission.</li></ul> | True</br>Remote procedure call (RPC) compression can reduce the CPU overhead when the bandwidth resources are limited. | Tenant-level parameter | No |

## Configuration examples

* Configure cluster-level parameters in the `sys` tenant.

    ```shell
    obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET large_query_threshold = '600s';
    obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET enable_syslog_recycle = True;
    obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET max_syslog_file_count = 300;
    ```

* Configure tenant-level parameters in a user tenant.

    :::tab
    tab MySQL tenant

    ```shell
    obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET _rowsets_max_rows = 32;
    obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET log_transport_compress_all = True;
    ```

    tab Oracle tenant

    ```shell
    obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET "_rowsets_max_rows" = 32;
    obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET log_transport_compress_all = True;
    ```
